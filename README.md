## My process

As always I added all the needed html components using emmet and did a simple css reset and general styling. Then I started by positioning the card in the center and gave it the display property of flex. Secondly I styled the card component so it resembles the design as close as possible and after that I added the Card picture using a div and background-image with background-size: cover; and background-postion: center;. After that I started styling all the card text with different font sizes and weights, also adding a background to the category component and a media query for the changing font size of the card description. Lastly I just touched up the profile photo and name components:
